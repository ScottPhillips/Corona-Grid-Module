Very rudimentary - but necessary! - function to render tabular or grid data in exactly that fashion, ie. a table or grid.

See grid.lua for example implementation and comments.

createGrid function requires two variables: design/layout settings and data to populate the table.

Could do with lots of extra features:
Padding, autosize widths, adding event listeners to fields, scrolling...

... list goes on and on.
